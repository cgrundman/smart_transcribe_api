# Smart Transcription API

This application is a basic Flask API that takes a sound file and transcribes what is being said, and then performs sentiment analysis on every sentence within the transcription. The transcription is performed by Whisper from Open AI (https://openai.com/research/whisper). The sentiment analysis is performed by huggingface. This is a simple templte for a backend Flask API, to be used proimary by myself or anyone interested.
